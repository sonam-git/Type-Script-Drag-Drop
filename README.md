## Description.
This TypeScript project aims to enhance project management capabilities within an application. Users can seamlessly add new projects, specifying essential details such as project name, the number of assigned team members, and a project description. Projects are initially displayed in the "Active Projects" section, allowing users to easily distinguish ongoing work. An intuitive drag-and-drop feature empowers users to transition projects between the "Active Projects" and "Finished Projects" sections, streamlining the organization process. The interface ensures clear visibility and easy editing of project details. The application prioritizes user feedback, offering confirmation messages for successful actions and graceful error handling for potential issues. Persistent storage maintains the state of projects between sessions, promoting a seamless user experience. As the project list grows, the application maintains responsiveness and usability. Overall, this project facilitates efficient project management, providing a user-friendly interface for organizing and tracking both active and completed projects.

## User Story:

```
As a user, I want to be able to manage projects in my TypeScript application. I should be able to add new projects, specify the number of people assigned to each project, provide project descriptions, and categorize projects as either active or finished. Additionally, I should be able to visually organize projects by dragging and dropping them between the active and finished sections.



```

## Criteria:

```
Given that I am using the TypeScript application,

1. I can add a new project with the following details:
   - Project Name
   - Number of Assigned People
   - Project Description

2. Each project is displayed in the "Active Projects" section by default.

3. I can mark a project as finished, moving it from the "Active Projects" section to the "Finished Projects" section.

4. The application provides a user-friendly way to visually organize projects by allowing me to drag and drop them between the "Active Projects" and "Finished Projects" sections.

5. The application ensures that all project details, including the number of assigned people and project description, are clearly visible and editable.

6. When viewing the list of projects, it is clear which projects are active and which ones are finished.

7. The user interface provides feedback or confirmation when a project is successfully added or moved.

8. The application handles errors gracefully, providing helpful error messages or prompts if there are issues adding or moving projects.

9. The state of projects (active or finished) is stored persistently so that it is maintained between sessions.

10. The application maintains responsiveness and usability even as the number of projects grows.
